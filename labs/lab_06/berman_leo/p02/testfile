The second program you have written is a good example of a program that does dynamic memory allocation. Such programming techniques are crucial to writing clean, robust code. The second program could have been written simply by allocating a large matrix that would hold the largest file you intend to process. For example, you could assume no file had more than 1M lines, and each line could be no more than 1M characters long. What would be wrong with writing the program this way and using this program on a time-sharing operating system in which you are sharing resources with other users?
If you fail to deallocate the memory you have allocated, your program will have what is considered a memory leak. Memory leaks and memory management problems are a common source of problems. For example, it is quite common that your cell phone will hang if you let an application run continuously indefinitely.
Source level debugging of code is a very important skill for a programmer. You have to get in the habit of using a debugger to fix problems with your code.
