Closed 9 years ago.

I have to work on a project involving huge amount of data stored in a raw text file. Each field is delimited by its size, ie, field 1 is from position 0 to 3, etc.. (not CSV file)

The file contains over a million lines.

I need to store it into a database. I checked several posts about what would be the best way to go about it, and it seems like the technology choice matters less than the algorithm. I'm open to Php, Perl or Python. Feel free to suggest anything.

Now, the file structure in itself is a bit tricky. Here is an example:

Basically, there are 6 types of lines, from A to F; line A is the header of the block. Lines B and C have the exact same length and fields. Line D is a possible complement to line C, meaning that it is attached to a line C but not required; also meaning there cannot be a line D without a line C. Lines E and F are independent lines, only attached to line A. (all lines are part of a block, so they could all be "attached" to a line A, or a virtual block ID)

How would I go about to create a model that would allow me to: - modify some data on some lines based on some criteria (ie, if 5th char of line C is 4, then 10th becomes 7) - keep track of the modified ones (ie, I want to be able to link them to their original selves) - Be able to rebuild the original text file, deleting the original lines and replacing them by their modified version - Be able to insert new lines in the block: if line C has 7th char = 0 then I add below it a D line. - keep the line order intact. (if one line is inserted, it moves the order for the following line by 1 rank ahead)

I thought about using a parent_id foreign key in all 5 line tables (one per each line type, since they do not have the same fields); thus resolving the line ordering issue, but I am stuck at rebuilding the modified file version. I also thought about dividing the file into blocks (starting by a line A), then linking lines to block ID...

Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot in advance!

I believe this is too complex to ask here with vague requirements. Perhaps you could rephrase your question in more specific smaller parts? I don't really care to design and implement your solution. –

Go through the file line by line and use a stack. Something along the lines:

<?php

// You'd have to implement the database yourself!
$db = new Database();
$db->startTransaction();

$stack = array();
$fh    = fopen("my-file", "r");
$i     = 0;
while (($buffer = fgets($handle, 4096)) !== false) {
  if (!isset($buffer[0])) {
    continue;
  }

  switch ($buffer[0]) {
    case "A":
      // Do something ...
      break;

    case "C":
      // Do something ...
      break;

    case "C":
      if ($stack[$i] != "C") {
        trigger_error("Line D without preceding line C");
      }
      // Do something ...
      break;

     // More stuff ...
  }

  $stack[$i++] = $buffer;
  $db->insert("INSERT INTO table (line) VALUES ($buffer)");
}

$db->commitTransaction();

?>
Of course there are better solutions than the ugly switch, but it's quick'n'dirty. Your database design answer is impossible to answer because we have no clue about the requirements. All in all consider posting your work and ask specific questions regarding a small piece of a big problem and not asking to solve big problems.
