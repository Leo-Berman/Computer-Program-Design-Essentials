These are the programs I either used to practice for quizzes/homeworks/labs or submitted to Professor Joseph Picone for evaluation.  By developing these programs/troubleshooting them I gained a deeper understanding of the languages C, C++, Python, and Bash, as well as an understanding of cloud computing as the work was done in a remote shell via cloud computing.
